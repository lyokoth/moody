mood based spotify playlists


Moodify uses the Spotify API to generate mood-based playlists. 
fter authorizing Spotify access to your account information, Moody can generate a playlist based on the valence of the song you last listened to, the higher the valence the more "positive" the song and vise versa. 



It can generate a playlist based on one of the moods available: Depressed, sad, happy, and elated.
